As a data scientist at RR Diner Coffee, the task is to use a decision tree to predict the demand for Hidden Farm coffee among the most loyal customers. 
With data collected from 710 customers regarding their demographics, purchase history, and interest in Hidden Farm coffee, the goal is to determine 
if more than 70% of these customers are likely to buy this legendary coffee. This decision will impact whether RR Diner strikes a deal with the Hidden 
Farm in China or not, potentially saving the business. The decision tree will classify customer preferences based on various factors, aiding in the 
strategic decision-making process.
